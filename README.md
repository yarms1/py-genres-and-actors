In `db/models.py` create table `Genre` with such fields:
- Char field `name`, name of the genre with the maximum length of 255 
characters.

Also, create table `Actors` with such fields:
- Char field `first_name`, name of the actor with the maximum length of 255 
characters.
- Char field `last_name`, surname of the actor with the maximum length of 255 
characters.

Inside `app/main.py`, create `main` function.
This function should perform these actions:
1. Create:
   - genre Western
   - genre Action
   - genre Dramma
   - actor George Klooney
   - actor Kianu Reaves
   - actress Scarlett Keegan
   - actor Will Smith
   - actor Jaden Smith

2. Update:
   - genre Dramma, set `name` to "Drama"
   - actor George Klooney, set `last_name` to "Clooney"
   - actor Kianu Reaves, set `first_name` to "Keanu" and `last_name` to "Reeves"
3. Delete:
   - genre Action
   - all actresses with the `first_name` "Scarlett"
4. Return:
   - QuerySet of actors with `last_name` "Smith" and ordered by `first_name`
   
Example:
```python
print(main())
# <QuerySet [<Actor: Jaden Smith>, <Actor: Will Smith>]>

print(Genre.objects.all())
# <QuerySet [<Genre: Western>, <Genre: Drama>]>

print(Actor.objects.all())
# <QuerySet [<Actor: George Clooney>, <Actor: Keanu Reeves>, <Actor: Will Smith>, <Actor: Jaden Smith>]>
```
